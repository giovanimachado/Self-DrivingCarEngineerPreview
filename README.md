Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project I detected lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  

- [P1.ipynb](../master/P1.ipynb): I detected lane lines in the videos provided by Udacity.

- [P1_RJ.ipynb](../master/P1_RJ.ipynb): I detected lane lines in a video that I recorded with my cellphone.
